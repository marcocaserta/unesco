===================================

---------------------------------------

This directory includes the code used to solve the challenge, along with the
needed documentation. Please:

* read the summary.pdf file (available in this folder) for an overview of the
  project, the algorithm, and the rationale behind the choices made.
* read the html documentation under docs/HTML for a detailed presentation of
  the code structure, the data structure, and other issues related to the
  implementation.

The code can be run using:

> java -jar unesco.jar

This will run the code with the default options (the home site is London, and
the algorithm is in "deterministic" mode.) Use the flag "-h" to explore how to
change the command line options. For example, to define a location, use:

> java -jar unesco.jar -l <latitude> -L <longitude> -s <stochastic>


UNITTESTS

Unittests were run using Junit4.12. The pool of tests have been divided in two
parts:

* tests of the evaluation functions (TestFunctionsCorrectness)
* tests of the feasibility of the final solution (TestSolCorrectness)

In addition, a number of assert() have been used during the development of the
code. These are not active in the current version.

NOTE: 
-----
If the linking of JUnit gives problems, please remove the reference to the
unittests and try again. More specifically, you will need to remove all the
import org.junit.* in Orienteering.java along with the two unittests in the
main (look for references to UNITTEST # 1 and UNITTEST # 2 in the main.)
